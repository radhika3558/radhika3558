### Hello, I'm Radhika! 👋

📊 As a passionate data journalist, I specialize in weaving narratives through numbers.

💼 My interests lie at the intersection of business, finance, and the economy, with a keen focus on how data underpins these fields.

👩‍💻 Currently, I'm on a journey of continuous learning, sharpening my skills in Python, pandas, web scraping, R, HTML, JavaScript, and various other tools essential for cutting-edge journalistic data analysis.

🌟 This GitHub repository showcases a blend of my academic projects and personal explorations, each reflecting my commitment to uncovering stories hidden within data.

Welcome to my world of data-driven storytelling!
